The Class Scheduling Problem (CSP) is concerned with assigning a number 
of courses corresponding to various students and instructors to classrooms 
taking  into  consideration  constraints  like  classroom  capacities  and 
university  regulations.  The  problem  also  attempts  to  optimize  the 
performance  criteria  and  distribute  the  courses  fairly  to  classrooms 
depending on the ratio of classroom capacities to course enrollments. The 
problem  is  a  classical  scheduling  problem  and  considered  to  be  NP‚Äê
complete. It has received some research during the past few years given its 
wide use in colleges and universities. Several formulations and algorithms 
have been proposed to solve scheduling problems, most of which are based 
on local search techniques.  
In  this  project,  we  use  a  hybrid  algorithm  which  combines  features  of 
Genetic  algorithm  and  Branch  and  Bound  algorithm  to  solve  the  class 
scheduling problem.
